Notes to self:
- Duplicating Sara's code. Login page is now home page. 
- Have commented out bcrypt because was causing erros which I couldn't easily resolve. 
- Then I want to try out the "startUserLogin" function on login page --> all working?
- Sara activates "accessPrivateArea" function after her login function ... do the same? 
- Need to redirect logged in user to private area 

TODO: 

3. Finish private page --> logout functionality (check token
disappears), return user to home page 

4. Make sure you can't just add "/private" to url and access 
the page without a token --> a useEffect checking token value 
in store? 

    ...But if we do add '/private' to url and we have a token, we
    do access the page. 

5. Compare with Vanesa's project

6. Do up design
